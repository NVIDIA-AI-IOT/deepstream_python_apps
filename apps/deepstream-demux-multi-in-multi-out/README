Prerequisites:
- DeepStreamSDK 6.3
- Python 3.8
- Gst-python

To run:
  $ python3 deepstream_demux_multi_in_multi_out.py -i <uri1> [uri2] ... [uriN]
e.g.
  $ python3 deepstream_demux_multi_in_multi_out.py -i file:///home/ubuntu/video1.mp4 file:///home/ubuntu/video2.mp4
  $ python3 deepstream_demux_multi_in_multi_out.py -i rtsp://127.0.0.1/video1 rtsp://127.0.0.1/video2

This document describes the sample deepstream_demux_multi_in_multi_out application.

This sample builds on top of the deepstream-test3 sample to demonstrate how to:

* Uses multiple sources in the pipeline.
* The pipeline uses `nvstreamdemux` to split batches and output separate buffer/streams. 
* `nvstreamdemux` helps when separate output is required for each input stream.

Refer to the deepstream-test1 sample documentation for an example of simple
single-stream inference, bounding-box overlay, and rendering.

This sample accepts one or more H.264/H.265 video streams as input. It creates
a source bin for each input and connects the bins to an instance of the
"nvstreammux" element, which forms the batch of frames. The batch of
frames is fed to "nvinfer" for batched inferencing. "nvstreamdemux" demuxes batched frames into individual buffers. 
It creates a separate Gst Buffer for each frame in the batch. For each input separate branch is created with the following elements in series
`nvstreamdemux -> queue -> nvvidconv -> nvosd -> nveglglessink`
So for two inputs, 2 separate output windows are created, likewise for N input N outputs are created.

The "width" and "height" properties must be set on the stream-muxer to set the
output resolution. If the input frame resolution is different from
stream-muxer's "width" and "height", the input frame will be scaled to muxer's
output resolution.

The stream-muxer waits for a user-defined timeout before forming the batch. The
timeout is set using the "batched-push-timeout" property. If the complete batch
is formed before the timeout is reached, the batch is pushed to the downstream
element. If the timeout is reached before the complete batch can be formed
(which can happen in case of rtsp sources), the batch is formed from the
available input buffers and pushed. Ideally, the timeout of the stream-muxer
should be set based on the framerate of the fastest source. It can also be set
to -1 to make the stream-muxer wait infinitely.
